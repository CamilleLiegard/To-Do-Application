# To-Do-Application

Here you can find a functional and straightforward To-Do application to help you get through your daily tasks.
The objective was to practice the development of a smooth design, easy on the eye and also functional on a daily basis.

This project has been developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Local Storage from JS.


As this is a simple tool that can be used by anyone, it is important to keep it nice and without too many options, but this it requires the knowledge of the following features of Javascript :

addEventListener() -> creating interactions with the user and the product.

document.createElement() -> create element from Javascript that will directly appear on the HTML file.

classList.add() -> create division inside the HTML elements.

appendChild -> Connect Parents and Child elements inside the code.

innerHTML -> Diffusion of contents within the Javascript file, onto the HTML content.

e.target -> connection between an event, what triggers it, and its original element.

localStorage.GetItem -> Saving information inside the local storage of the browser so that the content will not get lost in case of refreshing.

JSON.parse -> parsing items intro strings to make them readable inside the local storage.

JSON.stringify -> convert value into string so they can be process inside the local storage.

if() -> executing a determined function if one statement is true.

For each() -> executing a determined function once for each element.
